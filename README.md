## Checker Strategies

- Pieces on the sides are valuable because they can't be jumped.
- Don't bunch all your pieces in the middle or you may not be able to move, and then you will lose.
- Try to keep your pieces on the back row or king row for as long as possible, to keep the other player from gaining a king.
- Plan ahead and try to look at every possible move before you take your turn.

## Fun Facts

- The game of checkers is called "draughts" in many countries.
- It comes from an old game called Alquerque.
- Chess can be played on the same game board as checkers. (Also using similar code ;) )
- The game Chinese Checkers has very little to with Checkers and was invented by the Germans, not the Chinese.
- There are lots of different variants of checkers including a version that is played on a 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:

- Jim Haff an Jim Clark for helping in SEI-CC-8_SUPPORT when I had a question regardless of it being simple or difficult

- Alex Rowland and Thomas Choi for taking time to do zoom calls when I got very stuck or hit a wall

- My fellow classmates for listening to my frustrations in stand-ups as well as my accomplishments

- My brother David for spending about 3 hours completely looking over my code and helping me figure out how to MOVE THE DAMN CHECKERS.

## Bugs to still fix

- One rule of checkers is when you jump a piece and you have the ability to jump another piece you should be allowed to jump again. Currently the game simply changes turns regardless if this is a possibility.

- Leftbound error occurs if you try to jump a piece from lets say column 3 to column 1 and will not allow the jump and switches turns anyways.

- Some issues occur later on with the pieces being jumpable but the jump doesn't occur and instead changes turns causing a player to lose a turn.
